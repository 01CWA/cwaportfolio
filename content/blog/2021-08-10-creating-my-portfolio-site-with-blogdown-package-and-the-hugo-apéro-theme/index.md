[Jesse Mostipak's Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak) was highlighted in [Google Data Analytics Capstone: Complete a Case Study's](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone/supplement/umI9H/explore-some-real-world-portfolios) resources. I also viewed her personal site and loved how it looked. That's where I discovered the Hugo Apéro theme, which took me to [Alison Hill](https://alison.rbind.io/project/hugo-apero/) and the [presentation with R-Ladies Tunis](https://youtu.be/RksaNh5Ywbo) to learn how to install it, including a side trip into [Happy Git with R by Jenny Bryan](https://happygitwithr.com/).

This is just one example of the seemingly infinite (and generous) resources available to learn about data analysis tools.

Thank you to all!
